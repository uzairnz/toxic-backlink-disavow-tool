# Toxic Backlink Analyzer and Disavow Tool

This Python tool helps website owners analyze and identify toxic backlinks and generate a properly formatted disavow file for Google Search Console. It uses SEMrush-exported backlink data as input to streamline the process of managing harmful links and improving SEO performance.

## Features

- **Analyze SEMrush Backlink Data**: Automatically filter toxic backlinks based on spam score, excessive external links, spammy anchor text, and sitewide links.
- **Domain-Level Disavow File**: Generate a Google-compliant disavow file by extracting domain-level URLs.
- **Customizable Criteria**: Easily modify toxicity thresholds to suit specific needs.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures malformed or incomplete data is handled gracefully.
